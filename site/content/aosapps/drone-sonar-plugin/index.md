This plugin can scan your code quality and post the analysis report to your SonarQube server. SonarQube (previously called Sonar), is an open source code quality management platform.

The below pipeline configuration demonstrates simple usage:

```yaml
steps:
- name: code-analysis
  image: aosapps/drone-sonar-plugin
  settings:
    sonar_host:
      from_secret: sonar_host
    sonar_token:
      from_secret: sonar_token
```

Customized parameters could be specified:

```diff
steps:
- name: code-analysis
  image: aosapps/drone-sonar-plugin
  settings:
    sonar_host:
      from_secret: sonar_host
    sonar_token:
      from_secret: sonar_token
+   ver: 1.0
+   timeout: 20
+   sources: .
+   level: DEBUG
+   showProfiling: true
```
